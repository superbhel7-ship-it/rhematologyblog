    a: "Though it cannot be cured, it can be effectively managed with better treatment options and small lifestyle changes.",

    q: "Which joints are most affected?",
    a: "Knees are the most commonly affected in India. This can be due to our cultural habits, like squatting or sitting on the floor.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is it different from rheumatoid arthritis?",
    a: "Osteoarthritis is due to wear and tear, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition where the immune system affects its own joints. In RA, multiple joints are affected at the same time.",

    q: "Is surgery always required?",
    a: "No. Surgery is only considered when other treatments like medicines and physiotherapy do not provide relief, and it is the last resort your doctor would recommend.",

                    A joint is where two bones meet. The ends of these bones are covered with a soft and flexible tissue called cartilage. This cushion-like tissue allows you to move easily without friction. In osteoarthritis, <span style={tealHighlight}>this cartilage gradually wears down.</span> As the cushion becomes thin, the bones start to rub against each other. This causes pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced movement.

                    If the symptoms discussed in this article sound familiar, a proper diagnosis is the need of the hour. Joint pain that is persistent, limiting, or getting worse is not something to be ignored. A rheumatologist can give you clarity on what's happening to your joints and a plan for managing it. The earlier you take action, the healthier your life can be.
