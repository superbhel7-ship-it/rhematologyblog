  {
    q: "Can osteoarthritis affect people under 40?",
    a: "Yes, it can — but not very commonly. Osteoarthritis is often linked to ageing, but younger people may develop it after a joint injury, due to joint structure issues, or from jobs that put repeated stress on their joints. So it is not only an older person's condition.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does joint pain feel worse in cold or rainy weather?",
    a: "Many people notice their joint pain gets worse when the weather turns cold or rainy, and this is a real experience. One possible reason is that changes in air pressure may slightly affect the tissues around the joints, making them more sensitive. Even though research is still ongoing, what you feel is valid.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does osteoarthritis always get worse over time?",
    a: "Not necessarily. Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, but it does not always progress quickly. With the right care, regular movement, and healthy lifestyle choices, many people manage their symptoms well and stay active for years.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is osteoarthritis different from rheumatoid arthritis?",
    a: "Osteoarthritis happens due to the gradual wear and tear of the joints, while rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects both sides of the body, causes longer morning stiffness, and may also bring fatigue. Understanding the difference helps in choosing the right treatment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can squatting or sitting on the floor worsen knee osteoarthritis?",
    a: "Spending long periods in deep knee positions like squatting or sitting on the floor can put extra strain on the joints, especially if the muscles around them are weak. That said, it does not mean you have to avoid these positions completely — you just have to balance them with good posture and muscle strengthening.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is post-chikungunya joint pain the same as osteoarthritis?",
    a: "No, they are not the same. Chikungunya can lead to lingering joint pain after the infection, which may feel similar to osteoarthritis but has a different cause. A rheumatologist can help tell the difference and guide proper treatment.",

                      Osteoarthritis does not begin with an obvious warning sign. It begins quietly — a stiff knee after sitting through a long meeting, a dull ache in the fingers after cooking, a grinding sensation after climbing the stairs that wasn't there a year ago. When life becomes busy, it is easy to ignore these signs.

                    Osteoarthritis is a condition that affects both the bones and cartilage in your joints. Cartilage is a flexible and smooth tissue acting as a cushion in the joints. This cartilage, which protects bones from rubbing against each other, gradually breaks down. Over time, as the cushion wears thin, the joint and the tissues surrounding it start to react — causing pain, stiffness, and swelling.

                    Osteoarthritis can affect your knees, hips, hands, feet, and spine. Knees, hips, and hands are the most frequent sites. One of the reasons osteoarthritis often goes unnoticed early is that symptoms creep in slowly — which is why many people don't connect them to osteoarthritis until they've been living with them for many months.

                    Daily activities like walking, climbing stairs, or squatting place repeated stress on your joints. Normally, the body can repair this everyday wear and tear.

                    However, this ability is impaired in osteoarthritis. The factors that cause this damage can vary — and over time, this leads to the gradual breakdown of cartilage. When cartilage wears off, bones start to rub against each other and wear down.

                    If the symptoms discussed in this article sound familiar, a proper diagnosis is the need of the hour. Joint pain that is persistent, limiting, or getting worse is not something to be ignored. A rheumatologist can give you clarity on what's happening to your joints and a plan for managing it. The earlier you take action, the healthier your life can be.
