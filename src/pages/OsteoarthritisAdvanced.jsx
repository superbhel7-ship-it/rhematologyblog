  },

    q: "Are gel injections painful?",

    q: "How do I know if I need a knee replacement?",

A rheumatologist or orthopaedic specialist can help you assess whether you have reached this stage.",

                    For many people with osteoarthritis, medicines, physiotherapy, and lifestyle changes bring meaningful relief. But at some point, their sufferings go beyond the limit. The pain starts interfering with sleep, movement, or even simple daily routines.

                    Doctors have made consistent efforts with medicines and physiotherapy. You have made enough lifestyle changes. But these haven't helped you out of the situation - some special treatment options come into play.

                    Your doctor will suggest treatment options based on the joint damage and how much it's affecting your daily routine. In most cases, injections are tried before considering surgery.

                    Injections often bridge the gap between medicines and surgery. They are quick, usually done in a clinic, don't require hospital admission, and have no long recovery time. Based on your joint's damage, your doctor would recommend these options.

                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
                    Steroid injections are often considered the first step when your pain flares up. A small dose of a steroid is injected into your joint space. This reduces swelling and eases the pain. While it doesn't repair the joint or stop its progression, it can provide a helpful window of relief. This helps you have more relaxed and pain-free physiotherapy sessions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
                    Doctors generally limit these to 3–4 injections for a single joint in one year, as overuse may affect joint health over time. For some, the effect may last 4 to 8 weeks; for many it lasts up to 3 months.

                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
                    When you are healthy, fluid acts as a natural cushion in your joint. In osteoarthritis, this fluid becomes thin and stops working effectively. Gel injections add hyaluronic acid to cushion and lubricate your joints - helping you climb stairs without your knees creaking. The effect may last 6 to 12 months, though results vary based on the person and extent of damage.
                  </p>

                    It's worth noting that the evidence is mixed. While some people experience marked improvement, others may not. Some international associations like EULAR suggest cautious use. AAOS and ACR/Arthritis Foundation do not currently recommend these as standard treatment. So it's best to have an open discussion with your doctor before taking the final call.

                    Your doctor draws some blood - similar to a routine blood test - then processes it in the lab to get a thick, concentrated platelet solution. These platelets help in healing and repair. This fluid is then injected back into your damaged joint. Instead of just relieving pain, PRP aims to repair and improve joint health in a more natural way.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1.25rem" }}>
                    Doctors often consider PRP when other injections haven't worked well, especially in mild to moderate osteoarthritis. It can be a good option if you're looking to delay surgery and explore treatments that work with your body's own healing mechanisms.

                    While early results are promising - giving 6 to 12 months of relief in suitable patients - it is still an evolving treatment and has not yet become part of standard guidelines. Results can differ from person to person and depend on damage severity.

                    Stem cell therapy is one of the more talked-about recent options. Stem cells are sourced from the patient, processed in labs, and injected back into the affected joint. There is mixed evidence suggesting it could help regrow damaged cartilage.

                    Besides age, your doctor considers pain severity, walking ability, and how badly it affects your routine before suggesting surgery.

                    What Does Your Doctor Operate On?

                    Specialists replace your damaged joint with specially designed components made of metal and durable plastic. These act like a new joint surface, helping the knee move more smoothly and with less pain. The surgery usually takes around 3 to 4 hours, with a hospital stay of about 3 to 4 days.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1.75rem" }}>
                    Based on how much of the joint is affected, your doctor may recommend a <strong className="font-semibold">total knee replacement</strong> - when most of the joint is damaged - or a <strong className="font-semibold">partial knee replacement</strong>, where only the affected portion is replaced while preserving the healthy parts.
                  </p>

                    What to Expect in Your Recovery Phase?

                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1.25rem" }}>
                    Recovery is a gradual but steady journey. For the first few days, the pain is bearable and you can walk with support. After physiotherapy sessions, your knees start hurting less as you walk.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "1.25rem" }}>
                    Within three months, you can start walking and climbing stairs and will feel marked improvement. After this, you regain near-normal function. Full recovery depends on your age, fitness level, and consistency with physiotherapy.
