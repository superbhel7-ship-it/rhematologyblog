                    Rita is a 56-year-old first-time nanny. The excitement of being a new granny and dreams of enjoying her retirement journey were shattered the moment she heard that she was being diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Being diagnosed with osteoarthritis can make you feel overwhelmed at first. But it doesn't mean your life has to shrink around pain.

                    Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, and it doesn't follow a straight path. Some days may feel much lighter and easier, while others may hit you hard with stiffness or discomfort. For many people, it progresses slowly or stays stable for many years, based on their healthy routine.

                    A flare is a temporary spike in your pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can be triggered when you overuse the joint, sit still for too long, when the weather turns cold, or even due to stress.
                  </p>

                  <h3 style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-display)", fontSize: "clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem)", fontWeight: 400, lineHeight: 1.25, letterSpacing: "-0.2px", color: "#0f616e", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
                    What Helps During a Flare?

                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep" style={{ marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
                    During a flare, it is better to take ample rest. Applying a cold pack for 15-20 minutes can reduce your swelling, while a warm pack works better for easing your stiffness. Taking medicines as prescribed by your doctor and putting less pressure on the joint, like using support if needed, can make the phase more manageable. Whenever necessary, do not forget to use your walking stick or a brace.
                  </p>

                    A steady and healthy routine makes a big difference. Do not overwork your joint on good days. Stay consistent with gentle exercise, maintain a healthy weight and try to have a balanced diet. Keeping yourself warm in colder weather can help reduce the frequency of flares. These tiny steps make sure that you don't need to worry about flares anymore.

                    Including oily fish such as mackerel, sardines, rohu, and hilsa in your daily meal can provide omega-3 fatty acids that help reduce inflammation. A variety of fruits and vegetables, like papaya, spinach, and carrots, supply antioxidants that support your joint health. Whole grains such as brown rice, jowar, bajra, and oats help with weight control and pain, while calcium-rich foods like curd, ragi, and sesame seeds strengthen bones. Using healthier oils like mustard oil or cold-pressed coconut oil instead of refined oils can also be beneficial.

                    It is best to limit deep-fried foods like pakoras and pooris. Foods made from maida, such as white bread and biscuits, and sugary items like mithais and soft drinks can worsen your pain. Packaged and preserved snacks often contain high levels of salt and unhealthy fats that may negatively impact joint health.

                    During a flare, it is better to switch to much gentler or seated exercises. This reduces the intensity rather than stopping completely. As symptoms improve, you can gradually return to your usual routine.

                    Is Yoga Really Helpful?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-navy-deep">
                    Yoga can be a gentle and supportive addition. Some studies suggest that it may help improve pain, flexibility, and joint function. Safer options include chair yoga and modified standing poses. As these are slow and rhythmic movements, it doesn't hurt your joints much. But deep squats or high-pressure positions are best avoided.

                    Living with this condition can affect your mood more than just your joints. Many people with osteoarthritis experience low mood, anxiety, and poor sleep. This is common, and you are not alone. It definitely deserves attention.

                    Disturbed sleep, inability to follow your daily routine, and even some lifestyle changes like eating healthy and exercising could make you feel anxious and isolated. Prioritise your mental well-being equally. Studies say that when you are too depressed or anxious, your tolerance to pain may even drop. Try getting help as and when needed. Joining clubs or trusts for arthritis patients helps you build a healthier and like-minded community. This way, even healthier habits that were once boring become enjoyable.

                    Breaking tasks into smaller and manageable steps while setting realistic daily goals can make everyday life feel less overwhelming. Practising breathing or relaxation techniques can help during difficult moments. Counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy, which is also available online, may also be useful. Staying connected with family, friends, or support groups can give you emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.

                    At work, make simple adjustments such as setting up your chair and desk comfortably. Keeping your feet flat on the floor and taking short breaks every 45-60 minutes can reduce your strain. If needed, discuss modified duties to stay productive without worsening symptoms.

                    While travelling, choosing aisle seats allows easier movement. It also allows you to take some time to stretch or walk every 30-45 minutes. This can prevent stiffness. Carrying medicines with you and avoiding tightly packed schedules can make travel more comfortable. Make sure you eat healthy and have ample rest while travelling. One shouldn't forget to wear comfortable shoes with supportive soles while travelling. If you can, do not hesitate to customise the shoes for your needs.

                    At home, make some small changes. Install grab rails in the bathroom to make you walk with ease. Using non-slip mats and using western lavatories to avoid squatting can be a great benefit. Using long-handled kitchen tools can significantly reduce the strain on your joints, and avoiding sitting on the floor for meals and prayers can reduce the strain on your knees.
