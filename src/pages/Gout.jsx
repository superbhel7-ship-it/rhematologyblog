  "Extreme tenderness -even the weight of a bedsheet can feel unbearable during a flare",
  "Limited range of motion in the affected joint as the attack progresses",

  "Peeling or itchy skin around the joint as the flare subsides",
]

const causes = [
  { title: "Purine metabolism", desc: "Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines -natural compounds found in your cells and in certain foods. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood, passes through the kidneys, and leaves the body in urine. When this system falls out of balance, urate crystals can form and deposit in your joints." },
  { title: "Overproduction of uric acid (hyperuricemia)", desc: "Conditions like chronic hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, psoriasis, and certain cancers accelerate cell turnover, flooding the body with purines. A diet heavy in red meat, organ meats, shellfish, and alcohol -particularly beer -adds to the purine load." },
  { title: "Decreased excretion of uric acid", desc: "The kidneys handle about two-thirds of uric acid removal. Chronic kidney disease, dehydration, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and certain medications (thiazide diuretics, low-dose aspirin, cyclosporine) can all slow renal urate excretion, allowing levels to climb." },
]

const riskFactors = [
  { factor: "Sex & age", detail: "Men are 3–4 times more likely to develop gout than premenopausal women, because estrogen helps the kidneys excrete uric acid. After menopause, women's risk rises significantly. Most first attacks occur between ages 40 and 60." },
  { factor: "Diet", detail: "Regular consumption of purine-rich foods (red meat, organ meats, shellfish) and sugar-sweetened beverages raises uric acid levels. Beer and spirits carry a particularly strong association -beer contains its own purines and also impairs urate excretion." },
  { factor: "Obesity", detail: "Excess body weight increases uric acid production and reduces renal excretion. Visceral fat is especially problematic because it drives systemic inflammation that compounds the effect of crystal deposition." },
  { factor: "Medical conditions", detail: "Hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and heart disease are all independently associated with elevated uric acid. These conditions often cluster together, creating a cycle that worsens gout risk." },
  { factor: "Medications", detail: "Thiazide diuretics (commonly prescribed for blood pressure), low-dose aspirin, cyclosporine, and some anti-rejection drugs can elevate uric acid by impairing kidney excretion." },
  { factor: "Family history", detail: "Gout has a strong genetic component. If a close relative has gout, your risk increases substantially -certain gene variants affect how efficiently your kidneys handle urate." },
]

const diagnosisSteps = [
  "Joint fluid analysis (arthrocentesis) -the gold standard. A needle draws fluid from the inflamed joint to check for monosodium urate crystals under polarized light microscopy.",
  "Blood tests for serum uric acid levels, though levels can be normal during an acute attack -so this test alone isn't definitive.",
  "Inflammatory markers: ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) to assess the degree of inflammation.",
  "Imaging: Ultrasound can detect the \"double contour\" sign of urate deposits on cartilage. Dual-energy CT (DECT) can identify urate crystal deposits throughout the body, even between attacks.",
  "X-rays to evaluate chronic joint damage in patients with recurrent or long-standing gout.",
  "Ruling out conditions that mimic gout: septic arthritis, pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition), cellulitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and stress fractures.",

  {
    number: 1,

    desc: "The first priority is bringing a gout attack under control as quickly as possible. Treatment is most effective when started within 24 hours of symptom onset.",
    details: [
      "NSAIDs (naproxen, indomethacin, celecoxib) -first-line for most patients",
      "Colchicine -highly effective when taken early, especially within 12 hours of flare onset",
      "Corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone) -used when NSAIDs are contraindicated or for patients with kidney concerns",
      "IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab) -for refractory flares that don't respond to standard therapy",
      "Rest, ice, and elevation of the affected joint during the attack",
    ],
  },
  {
    number: 2,
    title: "Lowering uric acid for long-term control",
    desc: "Once the acute flare resolves, the goal shifts to preventing future attacks by bringing serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL -the level at which existing crystals begin to dissolve.",
    details: [
      "Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat) -reduce uric acid production and are the cornerstone of long-term therapy",
      "Uricosuric agents (probenecid, lesinurad) -help the kidneys excrete more uric acid",
      "Pegloticase -an IV infusion for severe, treatment-resistant gout that converts uric acid to a form the body can easily eliminate",
      "Low-dose colchicine or NSAID prophylaxis during the first 3–6 months of urate-lowering therapy to prevent rebound flares",
    ],
  },
  {
    number: 3,
    title: "Lifestyle modifications & dietary guidance",
    desc: "Diet and lifestyle changes work alongside medication to keep uric acid in check. These adjustments can meaningfully reduce flare frequency and improve your overall metabolic health.",
    details: [
      "Limit purine-rich foods: red meat, organ meats, shellfish, and anchovies",
      "Reduce or eliminate alcohol -especially beer and spirits",
      "Stay well-hydrated (aim for 2–3 liters of water per day)",
      "Increase consumption of low-fat dairy, cherries, and vitamin C-rich foods -all associated with lower uric acid",
      "Achieve and maintain a healthy weight through gradual loss (crash dieting can trigger flares)",
    ],

  {
    number: 4,
    title: "Ongoing monitoring & whole-person care",
    desc: "Gout doesn't exist in isolation. Our providers monitor the full picture -including the cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic conditions that often accompany it.",
    details: [
      "Regular serum uric acid monitoring (target: below 6 mg/dL, or below 5 mg/dL for tophaceous gout)",
      "Kidney function tests and blood pressure monitoring",
      "Cardiovascular risk assessment -gout independently raises heart attack and stroke risk",

const complications = [
  { title: "Recurrent flares", desc: "Without urate-lowering therapy, most patients experience repeated attacks -and the interval between flares tends to shorten over time. What starts as one flare a year can become monthly episodes." },
  { title: "Tophaceous gout", desc: "Years of elevated uric acid can lead to visible deposits of urate crystals (tophi) in joints, cartilage, tendons, and soft tissue. Tophi are painless initially but can erode bone and permanently damage joints if left untreated." },
  { title: "Joint destruction", desc: "Chronic crystal deposition causes ongoing low-grade inflammation that gradually erodes cartilage and bone, leading to permanent joint deformity and disability." },
  { title: "Kidney stones & kidney disease", desc: "Uric acid stones account for 5–10% of all kidney stones. Chronically elevated uric acid can also contribute to progressive kidney damage through crystal deposition in the renal tubules." },
  { title: "Cardiovascular disease", desc: "Gout is independently associated with a 60% higher risk of heart attack and a 70% higher risk of stroke. The chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction that drive gout also accelerate atherosclerosis." },

                    The good news is that gout is one of the best-understood and most treatable forms of arthritis. Unlike conditions where the underlying cause remains unclear, we know exactly what drives gout: excess uric acid. That means we have a clear target -and with the right combination of medication, lifestyle adjustments, and ongoing monitoring, most patients can eliminate flares entirely and prevent long-term joint damage.

                    <li className="text-[17px] leading-[1.75] text-navy-deep pl-1"><strong className="font-bold">Rethink your plate.</strong> Prioritize low-fat dairy, whole grains, vegetables, and cherries.

                    <li className="text-[17px] leading-[1.75] text-navy-deep pl-1"><strong className="font-bold">Limit alcohol -especially beer.</strong> Beer raises uric acid both by increasing production and decreasing excretion. Wine in moderation appears to carry less risk, but during active disease, cutting alcohol entirely is safest.</li>
                    <li className="text-[17px] leading-[1.75] text-navy-deep pl-1"><strong className="font-bold">Manage your weight gradually.</strong> Losing even 5–10% of body weight can lower uric acid meaningfully.
